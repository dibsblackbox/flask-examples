I see this on Chrome Version 39.0.2171.71 m. The behavior seems to be inconsistent though, I tried grading another quiz with a different assignment, and the above issue didn't happen. The first quiz had only 2 students submit and the second had over 50 students submit. I will keep looking into it and will keep you updated if I find any additional information.

Thanks for looking into it!

I am the only one using the Blackboard Learn 2012 (9.1 Q4 2012) platform and this happens with multiple students (4 or 5 out of 50 or so), and different browsers. The browsers include: Chrome (v.39), Firefox (v.33), Safari (v.8.0.2), and Internet Explorer (v.11.0.9600.17126). I was not able to recreate this problem, however I am seeing this message consistently. I also tested it on our testing site with no problems, and there was only 1 user who had the issue, however the behavior was inconsistent as mentioned before.

You could also test it with other versions of the browser and see if that fixes the problem. If you cannot fix it on your end, then you can report the bug to the developers.
